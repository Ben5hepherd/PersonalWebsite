# Personal Website

This project is to maintain my personal website. Currently it contains links to my side-projects, and displays my CV. I am also working on user account functionality. I will be working on implementing full unit test coverage in the near future.


This project comprises of:

**Front-end (client)**: Angular application with the Angular Material library

**Back-end (PersonalWebsite.Api)**: C# Web API application set up for using PostgreSQL database, utilising EF Core

**Dockerfile**: to create single image for both the client and API (not best practice but done for cost reduction in deployment)
