# Personal Website

This project is to maintain my personal website. Currently it contains links to my side-projects, and displays my CV. I am also working on user account functionality. Jasmine tests have been added for the Angular project, xUnit tests for the C# project.


This project comprises of:

**Front-end (client)**: Angular application with the Angular Material library

**Back-end (PersonalWebsiteBFF)**: C# Web API application set up for using PostgreSQL database, utilising EF Core

**Dockerfile**: to create single image for both the client and API (not best practice, but done in this case for cost reduction in deployment)
